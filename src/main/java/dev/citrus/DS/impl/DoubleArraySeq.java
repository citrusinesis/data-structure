 * A DoubleArraySeq keeps track of a sequence of double numbers.

 * that are not available in the bag class (start, getCurrent, advance, and isCurrent).
 * <p>
 * Limitations:
 * (1) The capacity of a sequence can change after it’s created, but the maximum capacity is limited by the amount of free memory on the machine.
 * The constructor, addAfter, addBefore, clone, and concatenation will result in an OutOfMemoryError when free memory is exhausted.
 * (2) A sequence’s capacity cannot exceed the largest integer, 2,147,483,647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE).
 * Any attempt to create a larger capacity results in failure due to an arithmetic overflow.
